Sarah was already there, making coffee. "Good morning," she said with a smile.

"Morning," John replied. He noticed the worried look in her eyes. "Everything okay?"

Sarah sighed. "I got a call from work. There's been an incident at the lab."

That afternoon, John arrived at the research facility. The security guard waved him through.
Sarah met him in the lobby. "Thanks for coming," she said. Her face was pale.

"What happened here?" John asked, looking around at the chaos.

Before Sarah could answer, an alarm blared through the building. 
"We need to get to the secure room," Sarah said, grabbing his arm.

Later that evening, in the secure room, John and Sarah reviewed the security footage.
"This is impossible," Sarah whispered, staring at the screen.

Dr. Thompson walked in, his lab coat stained. "I'm afraid it's very possible," he said grimly.
"The experiment worked better than we expected."

The next morning, back at John's apartment, they made their plan.
"If what we saw is true," Sarah said, pacing the room, "we need to act fast."

John nodded, remembering the strange images from the security footage. 
"Who can we trust?" he asked.

"Only each other," Sarah replied.`;

John placed a hand on her shoulder. "We'll figure it out together," he assured her.

"But what if we're wrong?" Sarah asked, turning to face him.
"What if we're making a terrible mistake?"

Dr. Thompson interrupted them. "There's no time for doubt," he said firmly.
"We need to make a decision now."`;

Her hands trembled as she reached for the phone. The fear was overwhelming.

John burst into the lab, excitement radiating from his face.
"Sarah! You won't believe what we found!" His joy was contagious.

But their celebration was cut short by Dr. Thompson's angry shout from the hallway.
"Who authorized this experiment?" he demanded, his fury filling the room.`;

export const EVENT_SAMPLE = `At 9:00 AM, Sarah discovered the anomaly in the lab data.
Shortly after, she called John to tell him about her findings.

During the afternoon meeting, Dr. Thompson revealed the truth about the experiment.
While the meeting was happening, strange readings appeared on all the monitors.

Later that evening, John and Sarah decided to investigate the basement lab.
Before they could reach it, the power went out across the facility.

The next morning, when they finally gained access to the basement,
they found something that would change everything.`;

Sarah also walked to the store that morning. The morning was bright and clear.
John thought about his conversation with Sarah. He had been thinking about it all day.
The bright morning sun shone down as John walked home.

"I've been thinking," John said thoughtfully. "About what Sarah said."
Sarah had said something important, something that made him think deeply.
The store was quiet when John walked in. He walked past the aisles slowly.`;
